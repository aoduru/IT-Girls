## Inspiration
There are racial disparities of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations in the United States that arenâ€™t being addressed. We have seen this in our own family and communities. We know that communities of color, specifically Black, Latinx, and Native American communities, have doubts about receiving the vaccine due to false claims and fake news surrounding the virus. This leaves our communities, and quite frankly everyone, vulnerable during the pandemic.


## What it does
In its current state, the website presents our ideas about the application we would like to build. That application would include facts about the best practices during the pandemic and the vaccine based on trusted, data-driven articles. It would also include eligibility information based on state location as well as a map to pinpoint testing and/or vaccine locations in the users area.


## How we built it
Our frontend is built in ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Bootstrap. In the future, we'd want to include CockroachDB to have self-updating eligibility tables.


## Challenges we ran into
Because everyone on our team was excited to try something new, we wanted to try learning a different framework. Our initial plan was to create a mobile application, but realized none of us had any experience with Android or iOS development. This was also our first time using TailwindCSS, which we learned very quickly, but ultimately realized that we didn't have time to create all of our own components. Lastly, the Domain.com site would not accept the code, so we were also unable to get the site a domain name.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We got our site deployed using Github Pages!


## What we learned
During the entire event, we learned about different companies, organizations, and people that are diligently pushing and fighting for more representation in the tech industry! We were also introduced to many new platforms and languages in each of the workshops.

This was truly a learning experience for all of us. This is the first time any of us have met and we were working together from different locations and time zones. During our research of the covid vaccine, we learned that the eligibility requirements are still changing and the process to receive it varies by state. 


## What's next for Covid19 Facts
The next step to implement our design and ideas. We want to build a central application that educates its users about vaccine progress, availability, and eligibility. We hope that with this application, we can provide facts on various vaccines that are currently available, combat fake news, and support communities of color in making this decision.

Additionally, since we are in a _global_ pandemic, we had the idea of creating some form of map/graph that updates users about global conditions and how to support other communities from their homes.
