                        <p>
                            There are racial disparities of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations in the United States that arenâ€™t being addressed. 
                            This leads communities of colors vulnerable during the pandemic.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="col-md-6">
                        <h4>Our Solution</h4>
                        <p>
                            We want to build a central application that educates its users about vaccine progress, availability, and eligibility.
                            Our goal is to reach Black, Latinx, and Native American communities, properly inform them about the vaccine, and reduce anxiety or doubt about getting the Covid-19 Vaccine. 
                            We hope that with this application, we can provide facts on various vaccines that are currently available, combat fake news, and support communities of color in making this decision.
